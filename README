Sukija is a program for indexing documents written in Finnish.


Sukija analyses words morphologically, converts them to a base form
(that you find in dictionaries) and indexes the base forms, so that
you find all inflections of a word by just searching for the base
form.

To use an English example, if you search for the word "give" you find
all documents that have "give", "gives", "gave", "given", or "giving".

This is very important in Finnish since Finnish words have literally
tens of thousands of inflected forms.
